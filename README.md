# Javascript: Building Interactive Websites Course Overview

Welcome! We're glad you're here learning us. This course assumes that you have a strong foundation in Javascript and by the end, you'll be able to build a front-end application. 

What do we mean by strong foundation? Make sure you're comfortable with the following topics:
- Variables 
- Functions and Scope
- Logic and Conditionals 
- Arrays and Objects
- Loops
- DOM
- jQuery
- Reading and fixing errors using Mocha tests

If you don't feel like you have this foundation, or just want a refresher, go through our Introduction to Javascript course first (it's free!) and then come back here. 

Here's an overview of what you'll learn in this course. We've grouped it into five high-level topics. 


1 Higher-Order Functions
Higher-order functions is one of JavaScript’s best features for building robust, maintainable applications. You’ll quickly come to grasp JavaScript scope, iteration, and function organization by working up to mapping and reducing over GitHub issues.

2 Templates
JavaScript applications frequently render state changes to the DOM, and you’ll master techniques for handling both raw data and how your users see it. Moreover, your templates will make it easy to do away with repetitive code.

3 Object-Oriented JavaScript
You’ll learn a modern object-oriented approach to JavaScript based on the language’s concept of a prototype. Object-orientation helps describe an application in terms of information and interactions, making your code easier to think about and explain.

4 Accessing Remote APIs with JavaScript
The web runs by sending data from one service to another, and you’ll learn how to tap into those streams of data for use in your applications. You’ll learn how to make web requests with JavaScript and how to interpret and use the responses in your applications.

5 Behavior-Driven Development
No application is complete until it has a suite of tests that verify its behavior. You’ll learn how to write tests for JavaScript, making it easier to develop your applications quickly.

Take time reading through the lessons. Some of the labs you encounter will be straightforward while others will be more challenging. Learning to program is hard and we don't dumb it down for you. Sometimes you might find yourself googling for the best way to do something, and we've designed this curriculum so that you do that. Learning how to learn and find answers is a big part of the coding journey. But any time you're stuck, also know that you can use the Ask a Question feature in Learn and we'll be here to help you out!

Happy coding!
